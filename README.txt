1. Adjust the 'AngleAdjustment' value in settings.txt.

	-this value is the number of degrees of rotation applied to your sensor.

   	-negative numbers are acceptable, they simply rotate clockwise rather counterclockwise. 

2. Save and close settings.txt

3. Double-click to run rotate_sensor.exe
______________________________________________________________________________________________  

*As long as you leave the rotate_sensor command prompt window open, your sensor will remain rorated. When you close the rotate_sensor window, your mouse will no longer have any rotation applied to it.
